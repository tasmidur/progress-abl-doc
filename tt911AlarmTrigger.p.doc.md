Below is an explanation of the provided Progress 4GL program, which handles 911 emergency call alerts for a PBX (Private Branch Exchange) system. The program processes data from a temp-table, determines the property (company) associated with the call, converts the call time to the property's local time, checks for duplicates, and generates an alarm if necessary. It also logs various steps for debugging and auditing purposes. I’ll break down the code into its key sections (or "blocks") and explain the purpose of each.

---

## Overview of the Program
The program is designed to:
- Take input data from a temp-table (`tt911AlarmTrigger`) containing details of a 911 call (e.g., call time, extension, dialed digits, etc.).
- Identify the company/property associated with the call.
- Convert the call’s UTC time to the property’s local time.
- Check if the call is exempt or a duplicate.
- Generate a 911 alarm if all conditions are met.
- Log key steps for debugging and auditing.

It uses an input parameter (the temp-table) and outputs a logical result (`opResult`) indicating success or failure.

---

## Code Breakdown and Purpose of Each Section

### 1. Include Files and Variable Definitions
```progress
USING TimeZoneConvert.* FROM ASSEMBLY.
/*------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Purpose:     
    Parameters:  <none>
    Notes:       
------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
{tt911AlarmTrigger.i}
define var l_cdateformat as char no-undo.
assign l_cdateformat = session:date-format.
assign session:date-format = "mdy".

DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER TABLE FOR tt911AlarmTrigger.
DEFINE OUTPUT PARAMETER opResult    AS logical  NO-UNDO.   
```
- **Purpose**: This section sets up the environment for the program.
  - `USING TimeZoneConvert.*`: Imports a time zone conversion library.
  - `{tt911AlarmTrigger.i}`: Includes a file defining the temp-table structure for 911 call data.
  - `l_cdateformat`: Stores the current session date format so it can be restored later.
  - `session:date-format = "mdy"`: Sets the date format to "month-day-year" for consistent date handling.
  - `DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER TABLE FOR tt911AlarmTrigger`: Declares the temp-table as an input parameter.
  - `DEFINE OUTPUT PARAMETER opResult`: Declares a logical output parameter to indicate the program’s success (`yes`) or failure (`no`).

---

### 2. Variable Declarations
```progress
DEFINE var  ipBWEnterprise   AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE var  ipBWGroup        AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.
def var utcdatetime as datetime.
define var p_origination_ext#   as char.
def var l_next_seq                  as int.
def var l_output_msg                as char no-undo.
def var l_operation_successfull     as log no-undo.
def var l_send_alarm_immediately    as log no-undo initial yes.
DEF VAR l_911_code                  AS CHAR NO-UNDO.
DEF VAR l_PropOrigin                AS CHAR NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE vccompanyname  AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.
DEFINE VARIABLE vcguestname AS CHARACTER NO-UNDO.        
define variable lcRoomNumber as char no-undo. 
DEF VAR opiCompany_num    AS INT NO-UNDO.    
def var ldPropertyTime as datetime no-undo.
def var l_cPropertyZone as char no-undo.
def var cresult as char no-undo.
def var ccommand as char no-undo.
```
- **Purpose**: Declares variables used throughout the program.
  - Examples include:
    - `ipBWEnterprise`, `ipBWGroup`: Store enterprise and group IDs from the PBX system.
    - `p_origination_ext#`: Stores the originating extension number.
    - `opiCompany_num`: Stores the company/property number.
    - `ldPropertyTime`: Stores the call time adjusted to the property’s local time.
    - `l_cPropertyZone`: Stores the property’s time zone offset.
  - These variables hold call details, time conversion data, and operational flags.

### 3. Initial Assignments and Logging
```progress
assign opResult  = no  
       opiCompany_num = 0.
find first tt911AlarmTrigger no-lock no-error.
if not avail tt911AlarmTrigger then return.
ASSIGN ipBWEnterprise   = tt911AlarmTrigger.BWenterpriseId
       ipBWGroup        = tt911AlarmTrigger.BWgroupId . 
       p_origination_ext# = tt911AlarmTrigger.BWuserExtension .
output to value("..\logs\DLL-911AlarmTrigger-" + string(month(today)) + "-" + string(day(today)) + "-" + string(year(today)) 
+ ".log" ) append.
put unformatted "Entry: " string(today) " " string(time,"hh:mm:ss") ","
        opiCompany_num ","
        BWcallStartTime ","
        BWdialedDigits ","
        BWuserId  ","
        BWuserName ","
        BWuserExtension ","
        BWuserPhone ","
        BWenterpriseId ","
        BWgroupId ","
        BWgroupName ","
        BWgroupAddress ","
        BWclidNumber ","
        BWclidName "," 
        BWsrcIpAdd "," 
        session:date-format skip.
output close.
```
- **Purpose**: Initializes key variables and logs the program’s entry.
  - Sets `opResult = no` (default failure) and `opiCompany_num = 0`.
  - Checks if the temp-table has data; if not, exits.
  - Assigns values from the temp-table (e.g., enterprise ID, group ID, extension).
  - Logs call details (e.g., timestamp, user ID, dialed digits) to a file named with the current date (e.g., `DLL-911AlarmTrigger-10-15-2023.log`) for auditing.

### 4. Determine Company Number
```progress
if  BWgroupId  <> "ooma-emergency" and BWgroupId  <> "peerless-emergency" then
do:
{BWgetJazzCompanyNum.i}
end.
else
do:
   if BWgroupId = "peerless-emergency" then

            return.
        end.   
   end.
   find first BW-ExtensionToUserName_Map where  BW-ExtensionToUserName_Map.BwUserName =  BWuserId no-lock no-error.
   if avail BW-ExtensionToUserName_Map then 
   do:
        opiCompany_num = BW-ExtensionToUserName_Map.Company_Num.
        p_origination_ext# = BW-ExtensionToUserName_Map.Extension_Num.
   end.
   else 
   do:
        find first BW-ExtensionToLinePort_Map where BW-ExtensionToLinePort_Map.BwLinePort = BWuserId no-lock no-error.
        if avail BW-ExtensionToLinePort_Map then
        do:
            opiCompany_num = BW-ExtensionToLinePort_Map.Company_Num.
            p_origination_ext# = BW-ExtensionToLinePort_Map.Extension_Num.
        end.
   end.
   if opiCompany_num = 0 and (trim(BWenterpriseId) ne "" and trim(BWenterpriseId) ne ? ) then   
   do:
        FIND FIRST if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter WHERE  if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter.InterfaceGroup = "PBX"
            AND if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter.AttrName = "BWEnterpriseCode"  AND 
            trim(if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter.AttrValue) = TRIM(tt911AlarmTrigger.BWenterpriseId) + ";" NO-LOCK NO-ERROR.
        IF AVAILABLE if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter THEN 
        DO:
            opiCompany_num =  if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter.company_num. 
        END.
   end.
end.
if opiCompany_num = 0 then 
do:
    assign session:date-format = l_cdateformat.
    output to value("..\logs\DLL-911AlarmTrigger-" + string(month(today)) + "-" + string(day(today)) + "-" + string(year(today)) 
    + ".log" ) append.    
    put unformatted "Property not found: " string(today) " " string(time,"hh:mm:ss") ","
            opiCompany_num ","

            BWclidName "," 
            BWsrcIpAdd "," 
            session:date-format skip.
    output close.
    return.
end.
```
- **Purpose**: Identifies the company/property number (`opiCompany_num`) associated with the call.
  - For non-emergency groups (`BWgroupId <> "ooma-emergency" and <> "peerless-emergency"`), it uses an include file (`BWgetJazzCompanyNum.i`).
  - For "peerless-emergency":
    - Looks up the company number in `if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter` based on the enterprise ID.
    - Exits with an error if not found.
  - For other cases:
    - Checks mappings (`BW-ExtensionToUserName_Map` or `BW-ExtensionToLinePort_Map`) to find the company number and extension.
    - Falls back to `if-Interface-ComLib-Parameter` if mappings fail.
  - If no company number is found, logs the failure and exits.

---

### 5. Check for Exempt Numbers
```progress
find first parameter_master where parameter_master.company_num = opiCompany_num  and 
           parameter_master.Parameter_code = "EmergencyAlertExemptNumbers" no-lock no-error.
if not available parameter_master then 
find first parameter_master where parameter_master.company_num = 0  and 
           parameter_master.Parameter_code = "EmergencyAlertExemptNumbers" no-lock no-error.           
if avail parameter_master then 
do:
    if lookup(trim(BWdialedDigits),trim(parameter_master.char_Val)) > 0  THEN 
    DO:
        opResult = false .
        message "error: 911 emergency number: " + trim(BWdialedDigits) + " does not send out alert."  . 
        return.
    END.
end.
```
- **Purpose**: Checks if the dialed number (`BWdialedDigits`) is exempt from generating an alert.
  - Looks for an exemption list in `parameter_master` for the specific company or a global default (company_num = 0).
  - If the dialed number is in the list, sets `opResult = false` and exits.

---

### 6. Time Conversion to Property Local Time
```progress
ldPropertyTime = tt911AlarmTrigger.BWcallStartTime.
find first ServerTZMapping where ServerTZMapping.propertyid =  opiCompany_num no-lock no-error.
if available ServerTZMapping then 
do:
    Assign  l_cPropertyZone = ServerTZMapping.TZoffset  .        
    utcdatetime =  TimeZoneConvert.TimeZoneConversion:UTCToProperty(INPUT ldPropertyTime, INPUT int(l_cPropertyZone), INPUT "d:\sdd64\config\SddTimeZone.xml")  .
    cresult = string(utcdatetime).
    if cresult ne "" and  cresult ne  ?  then 
    do:       
       ldPropertyTime = datetime(cresult).
    end.
end. 
if not avail ServerTZMapping or cresult eq ""  or  cresult eq  ?  or ldPropertyTime eq ? then
do:
   find first ext_company_num where ext_company_num.company_num eq opiCompany_num and 
           ext_company_num.Field_name eq "TIME-DIFF" no-error.
   if  avail ext_company_num  then 
   do:
      if ldPropertyTime = ? then ldPropertyTime = tt911AlarmTrigger.BWcallStartTime.
      assign  ldPropertyTime = add-interval(ldPropertyTime,ext_company_num.int_val,"hours") .
   end.
end.
output to value("..\logs\DLL-911AlarmTrigger-" + string(month(today)) + "-" + string(day(today)) + "-" + string(year(today)) 
+ ".log" ) append.    
put unformatted "Converted time (UTC to Property): " string(today) " " string(time,"hh:mm:ss") ","
        opiCompany_num ","
        BWcallStartTime ","
        BWdialedDigits ","
        BWuserId  ","
        tt911AlarmTrigger.BWuserName ","
        BWuserExtension ","
        BWuserPhone ","
        BWenterpriseId ","
        BWgroupId ","
        BWgroupName ","
        BWgroupAddress ","
        BWclidNumber ","
        BWclidName "," 
        BWsrcIpAdd "," 
        string(ldPropertyTime) skip.
output close.
```
- **Purpose**: Converts the call start time (`BWcallStartTime`) from UTC to the property’s local time.
  - Uses `ServerTZMapping` and the `TimeZoneConvert` library if available.
  - Falls back to a time difference (`ext_company_num.int_val`) if the conversion fails.
  - Logs the converted time (`ldPropertyTime`) for auditing.

---

### 7. Determine Cloud PBX Type
```progress
def var CloudPBXType as char no-undo.
CloudPBXType = "".
find parameter_master where parameter_master.company_num = opiCompany_num  and 
 parameter_master.parameter_code = "CloudPBXType" no-lock no-error.
 if  Available parameter_master then do:
  Assign CloudPBXType =  trim(parameter_master.char_val) . 
 end.
```
- **Purpose**: Identifies the type of Cloud PBX system (e.g., "peerless", "ooma") used by the property.
  - Retrieves the value from `parameter_master` to influence later logic (e.g., duplicate checks).

---

### 8. Check for Duplicate Alerts
```progress
if CloudPBXType  = "peerless" or CloudPBXType = "ooma" then
do:
    if trim(BWsrcIpAdd) ne "" and trim(BWsrcIpAdd) ne ?  then 
    do:
        FIND FIRST Alert_Popups where Alert_Popups.Alert_Type = 9 and 
                      Alert_Popups.propertyid = opiCompany_num  and 
                      Alert_Popups.AckIPAddress = BWsrcIpAdd  no-lock no-error.
    end.
end.
if not avail Alert_Popups then 
do:
    if  BWenterpriseId <> "ooma-emergency" then
    FIND FIRST Alert_Popups where Alert_Popups.Alert_Type = 9 and 
                  Alert_Popups.EventDateTime =  ldPropertyTime and 
                  Alert_Popups.Extension =   p_origination_ext# and 
                  Alert_Popups.propertyid = opiCompany_num no-lock no-error.
end.
if  avail Alert_Popups then
do:
    output to value("..\logs\DLL-911AlarmTrigger-" + string(month(today)) + "-" + string(day(today)) + "-" + string(year(today)) 
    + ".log" ) append.
    put unformatted "Duplicate found: "string(today) " " string(time,"hh:mm:ss") ","
            opiCompany_num ","
            BWcallStartTime ","
            BWdialedDigits ","
            BWuserId  ","
            tt911AlarmTrigger.BWuserName ","
            BWuserExtension ","
            BWuserPhone ","
            BWenterpriseId ","
            BWgroupId ","
            BWgroupName ","
            BWgroupAddress ","
            BWclidNumber ","
            BWclidName "," 
            BWsrcIpAdd "," 
            string(ldPropertyTime) skip.
    output close.
    assign session:date-format = l_cdateformat.
    opResult  = yes. 
    return.
end.
```
- **Purpose**: Prevents duplicate alerts for the same 911 call.
  - For "peerless" or "ooma" PBX types, checks `Alert_Popups` by IP address (`BWsrcIpAdd`).
  - Otherwise, checks by time, extension, and property ID.
  - If a duplicate is found, logs it and exits with `opResult = yes`.

---

### 9. Generate 911 Alarm
```progress
opResult  = yes. 
define var Pbxuser as char no-undo.
Pbxuser = replace(BWclidName, "|", " "). 
run Generate_911_Alarms (input opiCompany_num , input p_origination_ext#,input ldPropertyTime, INPUT BWdialedDigits,0,Pbxuser) .
if  trim (BWsrcIpAdd ) ne "" and trim(BWsrcIpAdd) ne ?  then
do:
    FIND FIRST Alert_Popups where Alert_Popups.Alert_Type = 9 and 
                  Alert_Popups.EventDateTime =  ldPropertyTime and 
                  Alert_Popups.Extension =   p_origination_ext# and 
                  Alert_Popups.propertyid = opiCompany_num exclusive-lock no-wait no-error.
    if avail Alert_Popups and not locked(Alert_Popups) then Alert_Popups.AckIPAddress = BWsrcIpAdd.
    find current Alert_Popups no-lock no-error.
    release  Alert_Popups.
end.
```
- **Purpose**: Generates the 911 alarm and updates records.
  - Sets `opResult = yes` to indicate success.
  - Cleans the caller name (`BWclidName`) and runs the `Generate_911_Alarms` procedure with call details.
  - Updates the `Alert_Popups` record with the source IP address if available.

---

### 10. Final Return
```progress
return.
```
- **Purpose**: Ends the program execution after processing the 911 call alert.

## Summary
The Progress 4GL program processes 911 emergency calls from a PBX system by:
1. Setting up the environment and variables.
2. Identifying the property/company associated with the call.
3. Converting the call time to the property’s local time.
4. Checking for exemptions and duplicates.
5. Generating an alarm if all conditions are met.
6. Logging key steps for debugging and auditing.

Each section plays a critical role in ensuring that 911 alerts are handled accurately and efficiently, with appropriate error handling and logging throughout the process.
Based on your query asking for a "flow chart or pseudo code," I will provide the **pseudo-code** for a 911 Alarm Trigger Process, as it aligns with your request and allows me to present a clear, structured representation of the logic flow. Below is a detailed and self-contained pseudo-code that outlines the key steps of the process, written in a simplified, easy-to-understand format.

### Explanation of the Pseudo-Code

This pseudo-code represents a process for triggering a 911 alarm based on emergency call data stored in a temp-table (`tt911AlarmTrigger`). Here’s a breakdown of the key steps:

1. **Initialization**: Sets up the output variable `opResult` and a company number variable `opiCompany_num`.
2. **Data Check**: Ensures the temp-table has data to process.
3. **Data Extraction**: Pulls critical fields like enterprise ID, group ID, extension, and call details from the input.
4. **Company Number Logic**: Determines the company/property number based on group ID and mappings, with fallback searches if needed.
5. **Exemption Check**: Skips processing if the dialed number is in an exempt list.
6. **Time Conversion**: Adjusts the call start time to the property’s local time using time zone data or a time difference.
7. **Duplicate Check**: Prevents duplicate alarms by checking existing records based on IP address or event details.
8. **Alarm Generation**: If all conditions are met, generates a 911 alarm with the relevant details.
9. **Record Update**: Updates the alarm record with the source IP address if provided.

### What Does `DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER TABLE FOR tt911AlarmTrigger` Mean?

In Progress 4GL (also known as OpenEdge ABL), this statement defines an **input parameter** for a program or procedure. Specifically, it indicates that the program expects a **temp-table** (a temporary, in-memory table) named `tt911AlarmTrigger` to be passed as input when the program is called.

Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. **`DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER`**:
   - This part of the statement declares that the program is expecting an input parameter. Input parameters are values or data structures passed to a program or procedure when it is invoked.
   - `INPUT` specifies that the parameter is read-only (the program can read the data but not modify it to send back to the caller).

2. **`TABLE FOR`**:
   - The `TABLE FOR` clause indicates that the parameter is not a simple variable (like an integer or string) but an entire **temp-table**.
   - A temp-table in Progress 4GL is a temporary, in-memory table used to store structured data (rows and columns) during program execution. It’s similar to a database table but exists only for the duration of the program or session.

3. **`tt911AlarmTrigger`**:
   - This is the name of the temp-table being passed as the input parameter.
   - The structure of `tt911AlarmTrigger` is defined elsewhere, likely in the included file `{tt911AlarmTrigger.i}`, which specifies the fields (columns) of the temp-table, such as `BWcallStartTime`, `BWdialedDigits`, `BWuserId`, etc.

4. **Purpose**:
   - This statement tells the program that it will receive a temp-table named `tt911AlarmTrigger` containing data about a 911 emergency call (e.g., call time, user details, dialed digits, etc.).
   - The program uses this temp-table to process the call data, perform validations, and generate an alarm if necessary.

---

### Context in the Code

The `tt911AlarmTrigger` temp-table is the primary input to the program. It contains details about a 911 call, such as:

- `BWcallStartTime`: When the call was made.
- `BWdialedDigits`: The number dialed (e.g., "911").
- `BWuserId`, `BWuserName`, `BWuserExtension`: Information about the caller.
- `BWenterpriseId`, `BWgroupId`: Identifiers for the enterprise and group in the PBX system.

The temp-table is likely populated by another part of the system (e.g., a PBX interface) and passed to this program for processing. The program reads the data in `tt911AlarmTrigger` to:

1. Identify the company/property associated with the call.
2. Convert the call time to the property’s local time.
3. Check for exemptions or duplicates.
4. Generate a 911 alarm if appropriate.

The `DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER TABLE FOR tt911AlarmTrigger` ensures that the program knows to expect this temp-table as input and can access its records and fields.

### Why Is This Needed?

In Progress 4GL, programs and procedures often need to work with structured data, such as multiple rows of call details. Temp-tables are a common way to pass such data between programs. By defining `tt911AlarmTrigger` as an input parameter:

- The program can process one or more rows of 911 call data in a structured format.
- The temp-table’s schema (fields and indexes) is predefined, ensuring consistency in how the data is accessed.
- The `INPUT` keyword ensures the program treats the temp-table as read-only, preventing accidental modifications to the caller’s data.

---

### Example to Clarify

Imagine this program is called from another part of the system. The calling program might look like this:

```progress
/* Caller program */
DEFINE TEMP-TABLE tt911AlarmTrigger NO-UNDO
    FIELD BWcallStartTime AS DATETIME
    FIELD BWdialedDigits AS CHARACTER
    FIELD BWuserId AS CHARACTER
    /* ... other fields ... */.

CREATE tt911AlarmTrigger.
ASSIGN
    tt911AlarmTrigger.BWcallStartTime = NOW
    tt911AlarmTrigger.BWdialedDigits = "911"
    tt911AlarmTrigger.BWuserId = "user123".

RUN 911AlarmTrigger.p (INPUT TABLE tt911AlarmTrigger, OUTPUT opResult).
```

In this example:
- The caller defines and populates the `tt911AlarmTrigger` temp-table.
- It passes the temp-table to the `911AlarmTrigger.p` program (the program containing your code).
- The `DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER TABLE FOR tt911AlarmTrigger` in `911AlarmTrigger.p` allows the program to receive and process this temp-table.

---

### Common Points of Confusion

1. **Where is the temp-table defined?**
   - The structure of `tt911AlarmTrigger` is defined in the included file `{tt911AlarmTrigger.i}`. This file likely contains a `DEFINE TEMP-TABLE` statement with fields like `BWcallStartTime`, `BWdialedDigits`, etc.
   - The actual data in the temp-table is provided by the calling program or system.

2. **Why use a temp-table instead of individual parameters?**
   - A temp-table allows the program to handle multiple rows of data or complex structures efficiently. For example, it could process multiple 911 calls in a single call if needed.
   - It also encapsulates related data (e.g., call time, user ID, extension) in one structure, making the code cleaner.

3. **What does `TABLE FOR` mean?**
   - It specifically indicates that the parameter is a temp-table, not a single value or a database table. This is a Progress 4GL convention for passing temp-tables as parameters.

---

### In the Context of Your Code

In your code, the `tt911AlarmTrigger` temp-table is used immediately after the parameter definition:

```progress
find first tt911AlarmTrigger no-lock no-error.
if not avail tt911AlarmTrigger then return.
```

- The `FIND FIRST` statement checks if there’s at least one row in the temp-table.
- If no data is found, the program exits (`return`), indicating there’s nothing to process.
- If data is found, the program extracts fields like `BWenterpriseId`, `BWgroupId`, and `BWuserExtension` to proceed with processing.

This shows that `tt911AlarmTrigger` is the core data source for the program, and the `DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER TABLE FOR tt911AlarmTrigger` statement is what enables the program to receive this data from the caller.

---

### Summary

- `DEFINE INPUT PARAMETER TABLE FOR tt911AlarmTrigger` declares that the program expects a temp-table named `tt911AlarmTrigger` as a read-only input parameter.
- The temp-table contains 911 call details, defined in `{tt911AlarmTrigger.i}`.
- It allows the program to process structured call data passed from another part of the system.
- Think of it as the program saying, “I need a temp-table called `tt911AlarmTrigger` to work with, and it’s coming from the caller.”

If you have further questions about this statement or need clarification on related concepts (e.g., temp-tables, include files, or how the temp-table is populated), let me know!
